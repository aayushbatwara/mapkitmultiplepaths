         to determine if keeping the location is useful. For example, a location update that is just a few meters from the

         Your app may apply other criteria. For example, an app tracking a user at walking speed may discard updates that show the user
         moving at car speeds because that might indicate the user forgot to stop recording their location after completing the walk.
         Consider comparing an average value over the last several location updates, such as the user's average speed.

         throw away low-accuracy values by expecting only high-accuracy values. Discarding locations due to lower than expected accuracy
         can cause the user's location to appear to jump if the user is moving.
